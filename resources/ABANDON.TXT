I'm so lonely.
I don't really know what happened, the crew is just... gone.
Where are all my friends?
Will you please help me?
I want to get out of here.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so confused.
Where is everybody?
I.., I think I've been abandoned
Did you say something?
Escuse me, I don't feel right.
Hello, can you help me?
Uhm, whe, where am I?
It's so dark, are you my friend?
I can't remember what happened. Have we met before?
I'm sorry, did you say something?
Oh, what? I was thinking about something else.
Excuse me, do you know where I am?
I feel so alone.
