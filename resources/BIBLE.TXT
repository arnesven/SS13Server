Look to the LORD and his strength, seek his face always
Set your minds on things above, not earthly things
In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind
Do to others as you would have them do to you
You are the light of the world
A town build on a hill cannot be hidden
Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say again, rejoice!
Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding
The name of the LORD is a fortified tower
Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good
Let everything that has breath praise the LORD
For all have sinned and fall short in the glory of God
You shall have no other gods before me
I will say of the Lord.  He is my refuge and my fortress
My soul finds rest in God alone: My salvation comes from Him
The kingdom of God is within you
God has poured out his love into our hearts
Seek peace, and pursue it
The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord
This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us
